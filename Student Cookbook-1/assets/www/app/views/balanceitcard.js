They include important vitamins, antioxidants, fibre and iron especially in green vegetables.</li><li>Lots of starchy foods like pasta, rice, bread, cereals and potatoes - they provide carbohydrates so good for energy to help you get through the day, try to eat wholegrains as they contain more fibre.</li><li>Some meat, fish, eggs, pulses and nuts, these foods provide protein required for growth and repair, lean red meat is one of the best sources of absorbable iron. The body needs iron for blood formation, transporting oxygen and production of energy, if you do not have enough iron you can feel tired.</li><li>Some milk and dairy foods eg cheese and yogurts - sources of protein, vitamin D and Calcium which is important for bones and teeth.</li><li>Only a small amount of foods that contain fats and sugars.</li></ul><p>In addition:</p><ul><li>Drink plenty of fluids - of the non-alcoholic type!! Such as water, tea, milk, juice, smoothies and less fizzy drinks.</li><li>Choose appropriate portion sizes, not excessive and eat 3 regular meals a day and healthy snacks. Don\'t skip breakfast - you might be tempted to have that extra 10 mins in bed but your energy levels are low in the morning and your body needs an energy boost to enable you to concentrate in your lectures. If you\'re short of time grab a banana - it\'s better than eating nothing!</li></ul></div>'
